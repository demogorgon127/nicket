        <h1>Protecting your children</h1>
        <p> PC time management is important for home and business users alike. Limiting time that your child spends in front of the computer is a good way to prevent him or her from getting addicted, which is alarmingly common nowadays. <br/> Uncontrolled access to games and Internet can cause serious psychological and physical disorders. Hence, preventive measures here are far better than treatment. In an office environment time management is necessary to protect the company from internet abuse and limit the use of some non-work-related programs. <br/> Even today, there are not so many time management tools that combine simplicity of the interface and configuration with a wide range of useful functions, thus every release of Parental Control Software Time Boss is of a great value for those who are in charge of computer administration either at home or in the office. (Time Boss is a rare case of a time management tool that combines both simplicity of the interface and configuration with a wide range of useful functions, â€¦.)</p>

        <h1>Why TimeBoss?</h1>
        <p>Time Boss runs smoothly, is stable and friendly to all other programs, including antivirus and antispyware software. It uses only the official insuperable built-in protection capabilities of the operating system without creating spyware modules or littering disks and the registry. That's why it doesn't affect the working speed of other programs. Time Boss password protection will not be corrupted if kid uses keyloggers and other software to try to intercept you typing a password.</p>

          <p><q>I do love Time Boss and have been telling my friends about it, it's the best parental control software I've found. I love not arguing with my kids about when to log off and the easy ability to give them a little more time if I choose.</q>

          <p><q>I am trying your sw. It looks very nice compare to others I have chance to try. My son always find some way how to crack sws which I tried [Salfeld, ParentalControl, Norton, ChildControl, ...] to make it non functional but with yours it was OK. Up till now the best parental control I see.</q>

          <p><q>Just thought I'd take a few minutes to say what a great bit of software Time Boss is. My nephew has been addicted to counter strike for a while now, and it was starting to effect his school work (too tired to concentrate in class I think). <br/> I've found Time Boss to be the perfect solution, does exactly what it says on the tin, plus is so easy to install and setup. Not sure ma nephew is too happy but he's getting used to the cut off time and we've already seen an improvement in the school work. <br/>Easily the best Â£30 I could have spent on sorting the problem. <br/> So many thanks!</q>

          <p><q>This software seems promising as my son has broken Microsoft Family Safety, Qustodio...etc. but so far this software seems to be able to limit his computer use time which is what I'm mostly after. Thank you for your assistance!</q>

        <div>
          <p><q>The program itself is brilliant and nothing else I've tried even remotely comes near to the features you've managed to pack into this! <br/> Its the right level of advanced control I wanted as many other programs try to oversimplify things (Microsoft family safety for eg) which ends up in me loosing key control elements...</q>
